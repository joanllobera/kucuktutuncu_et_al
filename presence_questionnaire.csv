100;1;25-34;4;1;1;1;2;5;4;1;3;6;6;5;6;A very real feeling.
101;0;35-44;6;1;1;1;3;2;4;1;5;6;6;5;5;Being a repetitive experience made me think about the laboratory and get out of the virtual environment a little
102;1;18-24;7;1;1;1;5;2;3;1;4;5;5;6;6;I couldn't stop noticing the clothes people were wearing, as there was one person who was dressed too casual {{jeans and pink t-shirt} to play in the quartet and another was wearing a lilac t-shirt that was quite out of place. For this reason, I have not finished getting into the experience
103;1;18-24;6;1;1;1;5;2;4;1;3;1;2;1;4;When the resolution was low, the sensation of dizziness was greater. The two colors made me feel equally present.
104;0;35-44;7;1;1;1;2;3;4;1;5;6;6;7;7;With the questions I reaffirmed the decisions I made and made me feel more in the virtual environment
105;1;25-34;4;1;1;1;5;1;4;2;3;3;4;4;6;"It did not seem easy to me to distinguish between the two types of visions and the two types of degrees of freedom. The other aspects showed the difference well. Spatial sound certainly makes a lot of difference. ""

The color changes made a lot of difference because it was closer to colors of a real environment and the other more with colors of a virtual environment."
106;0;18-24;6;1;1;1;2;4;3;1;5;3;1;6;7;I imagine that the characters could have more precise and human movements and have better definition of the images, but it will be done I suppose or it has already been done.
107;1;25-34;1;1;1;1;1;2;4;5;3;3;1;1;1;I have not been able to change any aspect of the environment. Only two screens have come out /color and degree of freedom/ but it did not give me the option to change anything no matter how much I moved my hands and hit the buttons. I cannot order the aspects according to importance because none of them have had any importance. This question is answered at random to be able to send the questionnaire.
108;1;18-24;7;1;1;1;1;3;4;2;5;5;5;6;6;I felt very good during the experience and I liked it a lot.
109;0;25-34;7;1;1;2;2;1;3;4;5;5;7;7;5;More realistic than I thought.
110;1;25-34;7;1;1;2;2;4;5;1;3;5;5;6;6;The experience has surprised me, I have felt truly immersed in what was happening and all the factors helped make it resemble reality. The surround sound and the quality of the graphics and the movement of the characters together with their musical elements have exceeded my expectations.
111;0;25-34;6;5;5;5;2;3;4;1;5;5;3;5;6;The repetition of the music track makes me more aware that I was in a virtual reality scene and not in the reality, simply because it is something quite unusual in the real life
112;1;18-24;6;1;1;1;2;3;5;1;4;5;5;6;5;Especially in the last part I liked it a lot and I perceived virtual reality almost as real.
113;1;18-24;5;1;1;1;5;1;4;3;2;5;6;6;6;During the last 5 minutes the immersion in the experience was greater since I had been able to find the options that were best for me. Once you have found the options that work for you, the interruptions to choose again made it less immersive and you remembered that you were in a virtual environment.
114;1;18-24;5;1;1;1;4;1;3;2;5;4;2;2;5;Not being able to interact with the environment it is difficult to think that it was not a virtual environment, when you can do things you disconnect more from reality. Also, by being able to modify your perception, it makes the feeling of just being difficult.
115;0;25-34;5;2;1;2;2;1;3;4;5;2;1;2;3;The buttons were too close, I've accidentally pressed the wrong option two times
116;1;18-24;6;4;2;1;2;4;3;1;5;7;6;6;7;For me it felt very real, but it was a bit difficult to keep my attention sitting all the time, after I had already defined how I liked the experience it was a bit repetitive.
117;1;35-44;7;3;3;6;3;2;4;1;5;3;2;5;4;"More beautiful environment... can be more imaginary, inspiring

Performers closer to center

Interior less distracting, more modern, plants to add life

From the windows '' could see the clouds moving or birds flying

Performers didn´t look 100 percent realistic"
118;1;25-34;7;2;1;7;2;4;3;1;5;6;5;6;6;towards the end it felt quite long
119;0;25-34;5;1;1;5;1;5;2;4;3;5;2;1;6;quality was not too good and the chair was placed inside the ground.
120;1;18-24;4;1;1;1;4;2;3;1;5;6;6;6;5;"First of all, what has made me have that feeling of being there the most has been the sound, since if I turned my head to one side or the other, the music went with me, or to the right or to the left.
On the other hand, the degree of freedom has also been very important since I felt more present if everything didn't move away when I tried to get closer. That way I felt much more out of the virtual environment. "
121;0;18-24;7;1;1;1;2;5;3;1;4;5;4;5;4;The experience was interesting, to improve the sensation of being inside, I would add shadows to the cadira and violinist
122;1;25-34;7;1;1;2;4;3;2;1;5;5;2;3;5;The color item seemed to me that I did not have the necessary strength to understand the difference, if I perceived the change of colors, but it could simply be some aspect of the decoration, beyond a change of perceiving reality alternatively.
123;0;25-34;7;6;6;6;4;2;1;3;5;7;5;5;6;nothing thanks
124;1;18-24;6;1;1;4;2;1;5;3;4;5;5;6;7;music variety is important, it gets boring after a while. There was no cohesion within the virtual characters 3 was wearing a suit but the woman on the right was wearing jeans. The animation synchrony at the end of the song was off.
125;1;25-34;3;1;1;3;3;2;5;1;4;2;1;1;4;had a bit of motion sickness, I had to close my eyes for a bit
126;1;45-54;5;7;7;7;5;4;3;1;2;5;4;6;6;facial animations were not really high quality. The color affected the dresses of the characters so full black suits were more plausible. The buttons didn't seem binary but rather incrementally increasing. The color option didn't feel in line with the rest, you can think of different representations of these things: like strictly black and colorful. The choice button should be a bit more separated.
127;0;35-44;7;7;7;7;1;4;2;3;5;5;5;7;5;Characters did not blink which was a bit weird.
128;0;25-34;5;2;2;3;2;5;3;1;4;5;6;4;5;It's been super cool
129;0;18-24;7;1;1;5;3;4;2;1;5;6;5;3;5;no comments
